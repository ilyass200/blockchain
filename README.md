# blockchain with python
blockchain draft developed in python 3.7 designed for Campus Academy for the 2nd year of the Campus Contest. 

# How does it work ?

To run the project, you need to first create a folder **/content** and then subfolders **/blocs** and **/wallets**.
After that, please make sure you have installed the following libraries: 
```hashlib, uuid, os, sys, json```

you can run the code using the ```main.py``` file at the root of the folder which will give a small preview of the result of the developed blockchain.
